🔹 Problem

Many children, especially younger ones, struggle to express their emotions verbally.

Traditional methods like asking “How do you feel today?” often don’t work well because kids don’t have the vocabulary or feel uncomfortable sharing directly.

Teachers, therapists, and parents need creative tools that help kids express emotions in a safe, engaging way.

🔹 Solution

Build an AI-powered tool where children can choose animals or objects that represent their feelings.

Example: “I feel brave like a lion but shy like a turtle.”

Or: “I feel bright like the sun but slow like a snail.”

The tool generates a hybrid image that combines the selected concepts into one unique creature.

The hybrid becomes a visual representation of the child’s emotional state — a way to “show” feelings instead of explaining them.

🔹 AI Formulation

This is primarily a generation problem (image synthesis).

Inputs: User-selected categories (Animal A, Animal B, ratio).

Output: Generated hybrid image (cat-lion, snail-sun, turtle-butterfly, etc.).

Optional add-ons:

Classification: Model labels the hybrid with “dominant features” (e.g., “80% turtle, 20% butterfly”).

Regression: If you track “intensity” (e.g., anger level from 1–10), the ratio could map directly to that number.
