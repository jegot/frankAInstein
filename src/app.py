# we'll just make an easy gui here for input

# users can choose their 'dataset' of 10 images that will be any combination of the static
# dataset within the program.
# 
# the model with be pre-trained somewhat on the dataset before hand, though it will only be 
# minimally as overtraining would dampen the learning purpose. 

# if we have time we should also let the user choose how many epochs the model goes through for
# further learning and testing
